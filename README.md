# Movie_recommendation-system
Movie recommendation system project using cosine similarity method in ML would require a good understanding of machine learning techniques and data preprocessing methods. It would also involve a good amount of data collection and cleaning to make sure the data is accurate and relevant for the system.
The movie recommendation system project using the cosine similarity method in machine learning (ML) would involve several steps:

Data collection: The first step would be to gather a large dataset of movies and their associated attributes such as genre, cast, director, etc. This data can be collected from various sources such as IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, or other movie databases.

Data preprocessing: Once the data has been collected, it needs to be cleaned and preprocessed to make it suitable for use in the recommendation system. This step would involve removing any missing or irrelevant data, and converting the data into a format that can be easily used by the ML model.

Cosine similarity calculation: The next step would be to calculate the cosine similarity between the movies in the dataset. Cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between two vectors, and it can be used to determine how similar two movies are based on their attributes.

Model creation: Once the cosine similarity has been calculated, the next step would be to create the ML model. This could be done using a variety of techniques such as k-nearest neighbors, collaborative filtering, or deep learning.

Model evaluation: After the model has been created, it needs to be evaluated to determine its accuracy. This can be done by comparing the model's recommendations to the actual ratings of users.

Deployment: Once the model has been evaluated and found to be accurate, it can be deployed in a web or mobile application for users to access and use. The system would recommend movies to users based on their preferences and the cosine similarity of movies.
